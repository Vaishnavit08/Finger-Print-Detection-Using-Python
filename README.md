# Fingerprint Matching

This project focuses on fingerprint matching using the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm and FLANN-based matcher in OpenCV. The aim is to accurately match altered fingerprints with their original counterparts from a database of real fingerprints.

## Overview

Fingerprint recognition is a crucial aspect of biometric security systems. This project leverages the power of computer vision and machine learning techniques to match fingerprint images effectively. The primary goal is to identify the best match for a given altered fingerprint from a set of real fingerprints.

## Features

- **SIFT Feature Extraction**: Uses SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) to detect and describe local features in the fingerprint images.
- **FLANN-based Matcher**: Implements the Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors (FLANN) for efficient matching of SIFT descriptors.
- **Robust Matching**: Incorporates a ratio test to filter out poor matches, ensuring robust and accurate fingerprint matching.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the matching keypoints between the sample and the best-matching fingerprint image.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of:
- **Altered Fingerprints**: Fingerprints that have undergone some form of alteration.
- **Real Fingerprints**: A large set of unaltered, real fingerprint images.

The altered fingerprints are matched against the real fingerprints to find the best possible match.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the fingerprint images divided into altered and real fingerprints.
- **scripts/**: Includes the main script for fingerprint matching and additional utility scripts.
- **results/**: Stores the output images showing the matching keypoints between fingerprints.

## Usage

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the Matching Script**: Execute the main script to perform fingerprint matching:
   ```bash
   python scripts/fingerprint_matching.py
   ```
3. **View Results**: The matched fingerprint images with keypoints will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## Libraries and Technologies

- **Python**: The programming language used for implementation.
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and feature extraction.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Google Colab**: Used for running and testing the code.
